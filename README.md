vimrc
=====

My .vimrc. Set up with Vundle.


1) First, set up Vundle:
```
git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle
```

2) Copy, hardlink, or symlink the .vimrc file into your home dir (be sure to backup your old .vimrc first if you want it)
```
cp .vimrc ~/.vimrc
```

3) Launch ```vim``` and run ```:BundleInstall```

Tips:
===

To use Fuzzy File Finder from Vim, use ```Ctrl-i```  in normal mode (when you're not inserting, pasting, etc.
